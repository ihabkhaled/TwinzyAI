# Glossary — The Workspace Vocabulary

> The shared dictionary for this NestJS backend operating system. One crisp line per term, each cross-linked to the rule, skill, or map that governs it. This file implements the canon in [architecture-map.md](./architecture-map.md) and [/rules/00-non-negotiable-rules.md](../rules/00-non-negotiable-rules.md); when a definition and the canon disagree, the canon wins.

Use it to settle "what do we mean by X here?" Terms are grouped, not alphabetized, so related ideas read together. Skim the **Layers** group first.

## Layers (the architecture spine)

| Term | One-line definition | Governed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Controller** | The HTTP transport entry point (`api/<feature>.controller.ts`): parses input via DTOs/decorators, applies guards/pipes, and delegates with exactly **one** call per method — no logic. | [/rules/02-controllers-and-http-transport.md](../rules/02-controllers-and-http-transport.md) |
| **Application layer** | Where orchestration lives — composed of services and use cases that coordinate domain, persistence, and adapters. | [/rules/03-application-services-and-use-cases.md](../rules/03-application-services-and-use-cases.md) |
| **Service** | A focused, reusable application/domain capability (`<feature>.service.ts`): CRUD, reads, single-write flows; methods stay ≤ ~20 lines; the **default** unit of work. | [/rules/03-application-services-and-use-cases.md](../rules/03-application-services-and-use-cases.md) |
| **Use case** | The escalation from a service (`application/<action>.use-case.ts`): one operation mutating **multiple entities under one transaction** plus ordered post-commit events. Use cases call services; services never call use cases. | [/rules/03-application-services-and-use-cases.md](../rules/03-application-services-and-use-cases.md) |
| **Domain** | Pure business rules — policies, entities, invariants, state machines (`domain/`). No HTTP, no persistence, no SDKs; fully unit-testable in isolation. | [architecture-map.md](./architecture-map.md) |
| **Repository** | The persistence boundary (`infrastructure/<feature>.repository.ts`): parameterized, bounded data access only — no business policy, no transformation. | [/rules/04-repositories-and-persistence.md](../rules/04-repositories-and-persistence.md) |
| **Adapter** | A typed, app-owned wrapper around one external library/SDK (`adapters/<vendor>.adapter.ts`) so business code depends on your interface, never the vendor. | [/rules/12-library-wrapping-and-adapters.md](../rules/12-library-wrapping-and-adapters.md) |
| **Port** | The interface an adapter implements — the app-owned contract the rest of the code programs against, decoupled from the concrete vendor behind it. | [/rules/12-library-wrapping-and-adapters.md](../rules/12-library-wrapping-and-adapters.md) |
| **One-way dependency rule** | Dependencies point inward and downward only: Controller → Application → Domain → Persistence → Integration. A layer never imports the layers above it (ESLint-enforced). | [/rules/01-architecture-and-module-boundaries.md](../rules/01-architecture-and-module-boundaries.md) |

## Module structure

| Term | One-line definition | Governed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Module** | One bounded feature under `src/modules/<feature>/`, wired by `<feature>.module.ts`, mirroring the layers internally. | [/rules/01-architecture-and-module-boundaries.md](../rules/01-architecture-and-module-boundaries.md) |
| **Module public surface** | The `index.ts` barrel that declares what other modules may import; cross-module access goes through this surface (or events), never another module's internals. | [/rules/01-architecture-and-module-boundaries.md](../rules/01-architecture-and-module-boundaries.md) |
| **`model/`** | The home for a feature's extracted declarations — `<feature>.types.ts`, `<feature>.enums.ts`, `<feature>.constants.ts` — so no inline shapes live in layer files. | [/rules/06-types-enums-constants.md](../rules/06-types-enums-constants.md) |
| **`lib/`** | A feature's named helpers: mappers, formatters, and helpers that keep services and use cases orchestration-thin. | [/rules/03-application-services-and-use-cases.md](../rules/03-application-services-and-use-cases.md) |
| **`@core`** | Cross-cutting infrastructure importable everywhere: logger, errors + exception filter, guards, interceptors, pipes, event bus. | [architecture-map.md](./architecture-map.md) |
| **`@shared`** | Dependency-light building blocks reused across modules: enums, constants, types, pure utils. `shared/` imports only `shared/`. | [/rules/06-types-enums-constants.md](../rules/06-types-enums-constants.md) |
| **Path alias** | A `tsconfig`/Vitest-synced import prefix — `@/*`, `@app/*`, `@config/*`, `@core/*`, `@modules/*`, `@shared/*` — replacing brittle relative paths. | [stack-and-toolchain.md](./stack-and-toolchain.md) |
| **Cross-module import** | Importing from another module's internals — **banned**; consume the public surface or react to an event instead. | [/rules/01-architecture-and-module-boundaries.md](../rules/01-architecture-and-module-boundaries.md) |

## NestJS building blocks

| Term | One-line definition | Governed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **DTO** | A Data Transfer Object in `api/dto/` describing a request/response shape; validation rules live here (class-validator primary), not in the service. | [/rules/05-dto-and-validation.md](../rules/05-dto-and-validation.md) |
| **Pipe** | A transform/validate step in the request lifecycle — the global `ValidationPipe` (`whitelist`, `transform`) plus optional custom pipes in `core/pipes/` (e.g. a Zod pipe). | [/rules/05-dto-and-validation.md](../rules/05-dto-and-validation.md) |
| **Guard** | A `CanActivate` access gate in `core/guards/`; protected routes chain an auth guard + a permissions (RBAC) guard + an ownership/tenant check. | [/rules/07-security-authn-authz.md](../rules/07-security-authn-authz.md) |
| **Interceptor** | A wrapper around request/response flow (`core/interceptors/`) for logging, timeouts, and response shaping — not business logic. | [/rules/14-observability-and-logging.md](../rules/14-observability-and-logging.md) |
| **Exception filter** | The global handler in `core/errors/` that maps a thrown `AppError` to an HTTP status + sanitized body, leaking no stack/SQL/secrets. | [/rules/18-error-handling-and-exceptions.md](../rules/18-error-handling-and-exceptions.md) |
| **Param decorator** | A typed accessor for request data — `@Body`, `@Param`, `@Query`, `@CurrentUser` — replacing raw request/response handling. | [/rules/02-controllers-and-http-transport.md](../rules/02-controllers-and-http-transport.md) |
| **Provider** | Any `@Injectable` wired through constructor DI with `private readonly` deps — services, use cases, repositories, adapters. | [architecture-map.md](./architecture-map.md) |
| **Constructor DI** | Dependency injection through the constructor — the only way collaborators enter a class; no service locators or manual `new`. | [architecture-map.md](./architecture-map.md) |

## Cross-cutting contracts

| Term | One-line definition | Governed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`AppError`** | The typed base for every user-facing failure; each subclass maps a domain scenario (not-found, forbidden, conflict, business-rule) to a status and a `messageKey`. | [/rules/18-error-handling-and-exceptions.md](../rules/18-error-handling-and-exceptions.md) |
| **messageKey** | A stable, localizable error identifier of the form `errors.<feature>.<key>` carried by an `AppError` and resolved per supported locale — never a hardcoded user string. | [/rules/16-i18n-and-messaging.md](../rules/16-i18n-and-messaging.md) |
| **Typed config** | Validated configuration read via `@nestjs/config`; the **only** place `process.env` may be touched is `config/` and `bootstrap/`. | [/rules/17-configuration-and-environment.md](../rules/17-configuration-and-environment.md) |
| **Logger adapter** | The `@core/logger` wrapper that is the only sanctioned logging path; `console.*` is banned and secrets/PII are redacted. | [/rules/14-observability-and-logging.md](../rules/14-observability-and-logging.md) |
| **Zero inline declarations** | The rule that no types/interfaces/enums/constants/DTOs/config-maps live inside controllers, services, repositories, use cases, guards, interceptors, or adapters — extract to `model/`, `shared/`, `dto/`, or `lib/`. | [/rules/06-types-enums-constants.md](../rules/06-types-enums-constants.md) |
| **Identity from token** | The principle that the acting user/tenant comes from the verified auth token, never from the client request body. | [/rules/07-security-authn-authz.md](../rules/07-security-authn-authz.md) |
| **Ownership/tenant check** | An application-layer assertion that the caller may act on a resource accessed by id — defense-in-depth against IDOR and cross-tenant access. | [/rules/07-security-authn-authz.md](../rules/07-security-authn-authz.md) |
| **Bounded query** | A list read with a hard max limit (default cap 100) and pagination — no unbounded result sets. | [/rules/09-performance-and-scalability.md](../rules/09-performance-and-scalability.md) |
| **Parameterized query** | A query whose values are bound, never string-interpolated — the persistence rule that blocks SQL/NoSQL injection. | [/rules/08-database-and-injection-safety.md](../rules/08-database-and-injection-safety.md) |

## Patterns & operational terms

| Term | One-line definition | Governed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Facade decomposition** | Splitting a god-file/god-class into a thin coordinating surface plus extracted services, policies, mappers, and helpers — the standard refactor toward layer discipline. | [/skills/decompose-large-file.md](../skills/decompose-large-file.md) |
| **Fire-and-forget** | A side effect (event handler, notification) dispatched without blocking the main workflow; it **must** catch its own errors so a delivery failure never fails the request. | [/rules/19-async-events-and-jobs.md](../rules/19-async-events-and-jobs.md) |
| **Post-commit event** | A domain event emitted only after the transaction commits, driving downstream reactions without coupling modules — owned by the use case. | [/rules/19-async-events-and-jobs.md](../rules/19-async-events-and-jobs.md) |
| **Idempotency** | The property that running an operation (job, retry, duplicate event) more than once yields the same end state — required for background and async work. | [/rules/10-reliability-and-durability.md](../rules/10-reliability-and-durability.md) |
| **Terminal state** | A definite success/failure/timeout outcome every long-running or async workflow must reach — no endless loading, no silent dangling work. | [/rules/19-async-events-and-jobs.md](../rules/19-async-events-and-jobs.md) |
| **Retry / backoff / timeout** | The explicit, bounded, observable controls every remote call and side effect must declare — never implicit or infinite. | [/rules/10-reliability-and-durability.md](../rules/10-reliability-and-durability.md) |
| **Dead-letter / replay** | The visible landing zone and recovery path for messages or jobs that exhaust retries, so failures are inspectable, not lost. | [/rules/19-async-events-and-jobs.md](../rules/19-async-events-and-jobs.md) |
| **Coverage floor** | The 95% workspace minimum (statements/branches/functions/lines) enforced by the test gate; critical paths aim near 100%. | [/testing/coverage-policy.md](../testing/coverage-policy.md) |
| **Quality gate** | The required-green command set — `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `test:coverage`, `build` — backed by Husky hooks; never bypassed with `--no-verify`. | [/testing/quality-gates.md](../testing/quality-gates.md) |
| **Request lifecycle** | The end-to-end path: guards → pipe → controller → use case/service → repository → post-commit event → interceptor/exception filter. | [architecture-map.md](./architecture-map.md) |
