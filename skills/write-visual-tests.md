# Skill: Write Visual Tests

Visual regression specs live in `apps/web/src/tests/visual/*.visual.ts` and run with Playwright via
`npm run test:visual`. They pin the rendered pixels of a page or primitive across the four axes that
matter in this repo: viewport, locale direction, theme, and content state. The standard is the
Playwright harness in [testing/e2e-testing-standard.md](../testing/e2e-testing-standard.md); rules in
[rules/frontend/15-testing-and-coverage.md](../rules/frontend/15-testing-and-coverage.md).

## Ground rules

- File name MUST end in `.visual.ts` — `apps/web/playwright.config.ts` matches
  `visual/**/*.visual.ts`.
- Always assert with `expect(page).toHaveScreenshot(...)`. Tolerance is configured centrally
  (`maxDiffPixelRatio` in `apps/web/playwright.config.ts`); never override it per-test.
- Screenshot only deterministic UI. The BFF gateway serves mock fixtures
  (`SERVER_API_MOCKING=enabled` is set in the Playwright `webServer` env), so data is stable — but
  mask or avoid anything time-relative (e.g. copy from a relative-time formatter).
- Name snapshots explicitly: `toHaveScreenshot('game-results-mobile-rtl-dark.png')`.

## Steps

1. Create `apps/web/src/tests/visual/<subject>.visual.ts`. Import `test, expect` from
   `@playwright/test` and navigate using paths that mirror `ROUTE_PATHS`
   (`apps/web/src/shared/constants/route-paths.constants.ts`): `/`, `/game`, `/privacy`, `/terms`,
   `/help`. Mobile-first (this is a PWA), so the mobile viewport is the primary subject.
2. Cover the three standard viewports with `page.setViewportSize` (the config runs a single
   `chromium` project, so viewports are set in-test):
   - mobile `{ width: 390, height: 844 }` (primary)
   - tablet `{ width: 768, height: 1024 }`
   - desktop `{ width: 1280, height: 800 }`
3. Cover LTR and RTL. Locale is cookie-based: `LOCALE_COOKIE_NAME` in `@/packages/i18n` is
   `'NEXT_LOCALE'`, with supported values `en` and `ar`. Seed it before navigation:

   ```ts
   await context.addCookies([{ name: 'NEXT_LOCALE', value: 'ar', url: 'http://localhost:3000' }]);
   ```

   `ar` renders with `dir="rtl"` on the document; assert the flipped layout with its own snapshot.
4. Cover the dark theme through the product, not by hacking the DOM: activate the dark-theme
   preferences toggle (`TEST_IDS.themeToggle`), then navigate to the subject page and screenshot.
   Theme is applied as `[data-theme='dark']` on the root element by `useUiPreferencesEffects` and
   persists via `STORAGE_KEYS.uiPreferences` (`'twinzy.ui-preferences.v1'`), so it survives the
   navigation.
5. Wait for stability before every screenshot: `await page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')` and,
   where content streams in, an explicit `expect(locator).toBeVisible()` on the last element.
6. Generate baselines for new snapshots only:

   ```sh
   npx playwright test apps/web/src/tests/visual --update-snapshots=missing
   ```

   Then run `npm run test:visual` again and confirm it passes with zero diffs.

## Per-platform baselines policy

- Playwright suffixes snapshot files per platform (`-chromium-win32.png`, `-chromium-linux.png`,
  ...). CI runs on Linux, so **Linux baselines are the source of truth** and are the ones committed.
  Local Windows/macOS baselines exist only to speed up local iteration; regenerate missing local
  baselines with `--update-snapshots=missing`.
- Never run a bare `--update-snapshots` to make a red suite green. A diff is a finding: either the
  UI change is intended (update the specific baseline and say so in the PR) or it is a regression
  (fix the code). Blanket baseline refreshes MUST be their own commit with the visual change
  described.
- `--update-snapshots=missing` is always safe: it writes only baselines that do not exist yet and
  never overwrites a committed one.

## Done when

- Each subject has mobile/tablet/desktop snapshots, an RTL variant, and a dark variant.
- `npm run test:visual` passes locally and no unrelated baseline changed in `git status`.

## Validation (gate)

```bash
npm run lint                # ESLint flat config — 0 errors, 0 warnings
npm run typecheck           # tsgo, strict
npm run build               # next build — Playwright builds/starts the app
npm run test:visual         # pixel diffs within tolerance; no unrelated baseline drift
```
