# Skill: Write Accessibility Tests

Accessibility specs are Playwright tests in `apps/web/src/tests/accessibility/` with the `.a11y.ts`
suffix (`apps/web/playwright.config.ts` matches `accessibility/**/*.a11y.ts`; run them alone with
`npm run test:a11y`). They combine an automated axe scan with scripted keyboard journeys — the scan
alone is not an accessibility test. Standard: [testing/e2e-testing-standard.md](../testing/e2e-testing-standard.md)
(Playwright harness); doctrine: [rules/frontend/13-accessibility.md](../rules/frontend/13-accessibility.md).

## Steps

1. **Create the spec** at `apps/web/src/tests/accessibility/<page>.a11y.ts`, one file per route
   (`home.a11y.ts`, `game.a11y.ts`, `privacy.a11y.ts`). The app runs against the mock-mode BFF
   gateway exactly as in [skills/write-e2e-tests-frontend.md](./write-e2e-tests-frontend.md), so
   pages render with real data.
2. **Gate on the axe scan.** Use `AxeBuilder` from `@axe-core/playwright` after the page settles
   (assert a ready-state `TEST_IDS` element first so you never scan a spinner):

   ```ts
   import AxeBuilder from '@axe-core/playwright';

   const results = await new AxeBuilder({ page })
     .withTags(['wcag2a', 'wcag2aa', 'wcag21a', 'wcag21aa'])
     .analyze();
   const seriousOrCritical = results.violations.filter(
     (violation) => violation.impact === 'serious' || violation.impact === 'critical',
   );

   expect(seriousOrCritical).toEqual([]);
   ```

   Zero serious/critical violations is the hard gate. Asserting the filtered array equals `[]` (not
   just `length`) prints the full violation objects on failure.

3. **Scan every meaningful state,** not just first paint: the upload form with validation errors
   visible, the results view, the error alert shown (drive it with the mock rejection sentinel), and
   — for theme coverage — after switching to dark via the preferences toggle
   (`TEST_IDS.themeToggle`), since contrast violations are theme-specific.
4. **Script the keyboard journey.** Every interactive flow MUST be completable without a pointer.
   For the upload flow:

   ```ts
   await page.keyboard.press('Tab'); // reach the skip link first
   ```

   Walk with `Tab`/`Shift+Tab`/`Enter`/`Space` through: skip-to-content link (the `app` namespace
   ships `skipToContent` copy targeting the landmark ids), nav, the consent checkbox, the file
   input, submit. Activate submit with `Enter` and assert the flow completes — no mouse `click()` in
   the journey section.
5. **Assert focus explicitly** at each stop with `toBeFocused()`:

   ```ts
   await expect(page.getByTestId(TEST_IDS.uploadConsent)).toBeFocused();
   ```

   Also assert focus behavior around dynamic UI: after a failed submit the error region (rendered
   with `role="alert"` by `apps/web/src/shared/components/forms/form-field.component.tsx` wiring) is
   announced, and focus is never lost to `<body>` when content swaps.
6. **Cover RTL once per flow.** Switch direction via the preferences toggle
   (`TEST_IDS.directionToggle`, backed by the ui-preferences module) and re-run the axe scan — the
   `dir` attribute flip can surface layout/contrast issues. Details:
   [rules/frontend/14-i18n-rtl.md](../rules/frontend/14-i18n-rtl.md).
7. **Run the gates.** `npm run test:a11y` locally; the suite runs in CI and any serious/critical
   finding blocks release ([testing/quality-gates.md](../testing/quality-gates.md)). Violations you
   cannot fix immediately require a documented, approved waiver — never a filtered-out rule.

## Definition of done

- `.a11y.ts` spec per route: axe scan (zero serious/critical) across default, error, dark, and RTL
  states, plus a full keyboard journey with `toBeFocused()` assertions.

## Validation (gate)

```bash
npm run lint                # eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y runs here, 0 warnings
npm run typecheck           # tsgo, strict
npm run build               # next build — Playwright builds/starts the app
npm run test:a11y           # axe scan (zero serious/critical) + keyboard journeys
```
