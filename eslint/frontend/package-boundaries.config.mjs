/**
 * Package boundary map: every third-party vendor has exactly one owning
 * wrapper directory under `apps/web/src/packages/<owner>/` (or the documented
 * `shared/` / `tests/` owner). This is the machine-readable twin of the
 * frontend package-boundaries contract — update both together.
 *
 * Owner prefixes are expressed in the plugin's internal `src/`-relative form
 * (apps/web/src/packages/axios -> src/packages/axios), matching how the
 * classifier normalizes apps/web/src paths.
 *
 * STRANGLER-FIG SCOPE: runs only on the new canonical folders — see
 * FRONTEND_ARCH_FILES in ./architecture.config.mjs.
