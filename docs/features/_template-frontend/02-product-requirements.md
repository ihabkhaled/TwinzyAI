# 02 — Product Requirements

> Turn the business analysis into testable requirements. Every acceptance criterion written here becomes a test in 06-test-strategy.md — write them so a Playwright spec or Vitest case could assert them verbatim.

## Scope

- **In scope:** <bullet the capabilities this feature delivers>
- **Out of scope:** <bullet what is explicitly deferred — this list defends the team during review>

## User stories

<One block per story. Keep stories vertical: a story that cannot be demonstrated in the running app (npm run dev, mock-backed via SERVER_API_MOCKING=enabled) is too horizontal.>

### Story <n>: <title>

- **As a** <persona>, **I want** <capability>, **so that** <outcome>.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  - [ ] Given <precondition>, when <action>, then <observable result>
  - [ ] Given <precondition>, when <action>, then <observable result>
- **Priority:** <must | should | could>

## State requirements

<Every data-backed screen in this repo renders four states — the GameFlowContainer pattern in apps/web/src/modules/game/containers/game-flow.container.tsx is the reference. Specify what the user sees in each:>

| State   | Required behavior                                                            |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Loading | <skeleton/spinner expectation — e.g. the "analyzing" processing state>       |
| Error   | <message intent — final copy is an i18n key, see 04-technical-refinement.md> |
| Empty   | <what an empty/idle result looks like and any call to action>                |
| Ready   | <the happy-path rendering — e.g. the results list with disclaimer>           |

## Localization requirements

- **Locales:** English and Arabic are both mandatory (SUPPORTED_LOCALES in apps/web/src/packages/i18n). <Note any copy that is hard to translate, pluralization, or number/date formats.>
- **RTL:** <any layout that needs explicit RTL attention beyond the automatic dir attribute flip>

## Non-functional requirements

- **Performance:** <e.g. list must stay smooth at N items — if N is large, plan VirtualizedList from apps/web/src/packages/virtuoso in stage 04. Twinzy is mobile-first: budget for low-end devices.>
- **Accessibility:** <target is WCAG-conformant per rules/13-accessibility.md; note anything unusual: drag-drop, live regions, focus traps>
- **Security/privacy:** <any sensitive data displayed or collected — feeds 08-security-review.md. Twinzy non-negotiables: no image persistence, no identity/face-match claims, upload requires explicit consent.>

## Open questions

| Question   | Owner  | Needed by | Answer               |
| ---------- | ------ | --------- | -------------------- |
| <question> | <name> | <stage>   | <fill when resolved> |

## Gate

- [ ] Every acceptance criterion is testable as written
- [ ] Loading/error/empty/ready specified for every data-backed view
- [ ] Out-of-scope list agreed with the sponsor
- [ ] No open question blocks stage 03 or 04
