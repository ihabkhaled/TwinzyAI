# 07 — Implementation Plan

> Break stages 04–06 into ordered, reviewable slices. Each task names the skill that scaffolds it — the skills encode the repo's conventions so nothing is improvised.

## Build order

<The proven order for a data-backed feature: wire types + mocks → schema + mapper → gateway → service → query keys → queries/mutations → hooks → components → containers → route → tests alongside each slice. Adjust as needed.>

## PR slicing

<Group tasks into PRs. Every PR must pass `npm run validate` on its own — no PR may leave the repo in a state that fails lint (--max-warnings=0), typecheck, tests, or coverage.>

| PR  | Tasks  | Reviewable claim                                         |
| --- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | <1–5>  | <"data layer complete, mock-served via the BFF gateway"> |
| 2   | <8–12> | <"screen renders all four states">                       |

## Estimation and staffing

- **Estimate:** <effort per PR, total>
- **Implementer(s):** <names>
- **Reviewer(s):** <names — plus which reviewer roles run on which PR>

## Feature flags / rollout

<Does this ship dark, behind a flag, or directly? This repo has no flag service by default — if gating is needed, describe the mechanism (e.g. env-driven via apps/web/src/packages/env) and its removal plan.>

## Definition of done (per PR)

- [ ] `npm run validate` passes locally (lint, format:check, typecheck, tests, coverage)
- [ ] `npm run quality` passes (knip dead code, madge circular deps)
- [ ] Tests from the stage-06 matrix for the touched slices are included in the same PR
- [ ] Conventional commit messages; hooks in .husky/ not bypassed
- [ ] Review checklist [rules/23-review-checklist.md](../../../rules/23-review-checklist.md) applied

## Gate

- [ ] Every task has an owner, a skill (or "—"), and named outputs
- [ ] PR slices individually pass the definition of done
- [ ] Rollout approach agreed
