# Frontend Memory

Durable, reusable engineering knowledge for the Twinzy **frontend** (`apps/web`): decisions we made,
why we made them, and pitfalls we already paid for. Memory exists so that no human or AI agent
re-litigates a settled trade-off or re-hits a known failure mode. This is the frontend sibling of
the backend [`memory/`](../) flat track; it pairs with [`context/frontend/`](../../context/frontend/)
and [`rules/frontend/`](../../rules/frontend/). Adapted from the reference frontend OS.

## What memory is (and is not)

- Memory records **decisions and pitfalls**, with the reasoning that produced them. Every entry
  names the alternative that was rejected and the concrete area that embodies the decision.
- Memory is **not** a rulebook. Normative MUST/never language lives in
  [`rules/frontend/`](../../rules/frontend/). When a memory entry is promoted to a hard rule, the
  rule file is the enforcement surface and the memory entry keeps the rationale.
- Memory never contains secrets, credentials, tokens, or customer data. Secret handling is covered
  by [`rules/frontend/11-security.md`](../../rules/frontend/11-security.md) and the Trivy gate
  (`npm run security:scan`).
- Lifecycle governance (SDLC phases, gates, approvals) lives in the root [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md);
  memory holds the smaller package-level and tooling-level decisions.

## How agents MUST consult memory

1. Before proposing a dependency change, read [package-decisions.md](./package-decisions.md) — the
   alternative you are about to suggest was probably already evaluated.
2. Before debugging a toolchain or type error, scan [known-pitfalls.md](./known-pitfalls.md) — most
   "mysterious" failures in this stack are already documented with their fix.
3. Before changing test thresholds, security posture, performance defaults, i18n behavior,
   accessibility patterns, or design tokens, read the matching decision file below and either comply
   or write a new dated entry explaining the supersession.
4. When you learn something durable during a task (a new pitfall, a new trade-off), append it to the
   matching file in the same change — memory is maintained, not archaeological.

## Entry format

Each entry states: **Decision** (one sentence), **Rejected alternative(s)**, **Why**, and **Where it
lives** (real areas/paths). Pitfall entries state: **Symptom**, **Cause**, **Fix**, **Where encoded**.
Keep entries short enough to be read before every relevant task.
