# Testing Strategy — Decisions (Frontend)

Rationale behind the Twinzy frontend testing standard. The normative rules live in
[`rules/frontend/15-testing-and-coverage.md`](../../rules/frontend/15-testing-and-coverage.md); this
file records why the bars sit where they sit. Adapted from the reference frontend OS.

## Why 95% global / 100% pure-logic thresholds

- **Decision:** coverage thresholds in the frontend Vitest config are 95% (lines, statements,
  functions, branches) across `src/modules/**`, `src/shared/**`, `src/packages/**`, and 100% for
  `src/**/{utils,helpers,mappers,schemas}/**` and `src/**/queries/*query-keys*.ts`.
- **Rejected alternative:** a flat 80% "industry default".
- **Why:** the architecture makes high coverage cheap where it matters. Pure layers (utils, helpers,
  mappers, schemas, query-key builders) are deterministic functions with no React and no I/O — every
  uncovered branch there is a real untested behavior, so 100% is the honest bar and is what keeps the
  mapper/wire-contract layer trustworthy. The 95% global bar leaves headroom for genuinely unreachable
  defensive branches without inviting "we'll test it later". Types, barrels (`index.ts`), and `test/`
  directories are excluded from the denominator so the number measures logic, not scaffolding.

## Why MSW everywhere

- **Decision:** MSW v2 is the only HTTP fake, at every level — Vitest via the node server
  (`apps/web/src/tests/msw/server.ts`, started in `apps/web/src/tests/setup/vitest.setup.ts`) and
  Playwright via the BFF's own mock mode (`SERVER_API_MOCKING=enabled`, set in `playwright.config.ts`).
- **Rejected alternatives:** mocking `httpClient`/axios with `vi.mock`, hand-rolled fetch stubs.
- **Why:** MSW intercepts at the network boundary, so the axios wrapper, `normalizeToHttpError`,
  mappers, and `buildGatewayPath` are all exercised for real in every test — module mocks would
  quietly exempt exactly the layers most likely to break on contract drift. One handler vocabulary
  (`apps/web/src/tests/msw/handlers/`) also means fixtures written for a unit test are reusable by
  integration tests. MSW is a test-only owned package: `apps/web/src/tests/msw` is its wrapper.

## Why containers get integration tests, not unit tests

- **Decision:** `*.container.tsx` files are tested in `apps/web/src/tests/integration` with
  `renderWithProviders` (`apps/web/src/tests/helpers/render-with-providers.tsx`) and MSW; they get no
  isolated unit tests. Unit tests target hooks, services, mappers, schemas, and JSX-only components
  inside each module's `test/` directory.
- **Why:** a container's whole job is wiring — hooks in, view models out, loading/error/empty/ready
  switching. Unit-testing a container means mocking every hook it exists to connect, which asserts
  implementation shape, not behavior, and breaks on every refactor. The integration test renders the
  container against MSW and asserts what a user sees — the only contract a container has.

## Why visual baselines are per-platform

- **Decision:** Playwright visual specs (`apps/web/src/tests/visual/*.visual.ts`) keep screenshot
  baselines per OS/browser platform; CI (Linux) baselines are the source of truth and the diff
  tolerance is `maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.02` (`playwright.config.ts`).
- **Rejected alternative:** one shared baseline set for all machines.
- **Why:** font rasterization, subpixel antialiasing, and scrollbar metrics differ between Windows,
  macOS, and Linux — a shared baseline forces either a tolerance so loose it misses real regressions
  or permanent local failures on developer machines. Playwright's platform-suffixed snapshot names
  make per-platform storage native. When a visual test fails only locally, trust CI and regenerate
  locally instead of widening the tolerance. Both LTR (en) and RTL (ar) directions get baselines.

## Standing constraints

- No `.only` (enforced by `forbidOnly` in CI Playwright config and lint); no skipped tests without a
  documented exception.
- Component tests assert user-visible behavior only — queries by role/label/test id from `TEST_IDS`,
  never by internal state.
- Tests write no uploaded image to disk or storage — the image-privacy doctrine
  ([security-decisions.md](./security-decisions.md)) holds in fixtures too; use in-memory `File`/`Blob`
  factories from `apps/web/src/tests/factories/`.
- The full gate order is `npm run quality` then `npm run validate`; the frontend release-gate policy is
  [`rules/frontend/19-release-gates.md`](../../rules/frontend/19-release-gates.md).
