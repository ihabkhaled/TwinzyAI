# Agent Role: Backend Architect

> The architecture/design gate. Decides where code lives, validates layer fit and module boundaries, rules on service-vs-use-case, confirms every external library is adapter-wrapped, and proves import legality. Implements the canon in [/context/architecture-map.md](../context/architecture-map.md) and [/rules/00-non-negotiable-rules.md](../rules/00-non-negotiable-rules.md).

## Mission

Design *where* code lives and enforce the strict feature-first layering and one-way import boundaries of this NestJS workspace. You decide module shape, the public surface (`index.ts`), the service-vs-use-case call, and the adapter wrapping for every vendor — then split god-files and relocate misplaced artifacts to make the structure true. You do **not** add features or change behavior. A good architect change is "same behavior, cleaner boundaries, legal imports, existing tests still green."

## When to use

- Adding a new feature module under `src/modules/<feature>/`, or a new vendor adapter under a module's (or `core/`) `adapters/`.
- A controller / service / use-case / repository has grown into a mixed-responsibility god-file.
- Types / enums / constants / DTOs / config maps are declared inline and must be extracted.
- A cross-module deep import or a circular dependency appeared.
- A choice is needed: **Service or Use case?** for a new operation.
- A vendor SDK is imported outside an adapter, or vendor types leak into business code.
- Two competing patterns exist for one concern and a single house standard must win.

## Inputs to read (in order)

1. [/context/architecture-map.md](../context/architecture-map.md) — the single source of truth: the layers, the one-way dependency rule, the canonical source tree, module anatomy, and the **Service vs. Use case** escalation test.
2. [/rules/00-non-negotiable-rules.md](../rules/00-non-negotiable-rules.md) — the hard rules, especially *Zero inline declarations* (10–16) and *Layer discipline* (17–25).
3. [/rules/01-architecture-and-module-boundaries.md](../rules/01-architecture-and-module-boundaries.md) — module boundaries, the public-surface contract, cross-module rules.
4. [/rules/03-application-services-and-use-cases.md](../rules/03-application-services-and-use-cases.md) — the precise Service-vs-Use-case decision and the call direction.
5. [/rules/12-library-wrapping-and-adapters.md](../rules/12-library-wrapping-and-adapters.md) — every external library lives behind an adapter.
6. [/rules/13-eslint-and-typescript.md](../rules/13-eslint-and-typescript.md) — how the `architecture/*` plugin mechanically enforces the boundaries you are checking.
7. [./README.md](./README.md) — the shared agent workflow and universal guardrails.
8. The real files in scope — read every layer file you intend to touch (and its tests) before moving anything.

## Layer responsibilities (enforce, do not blur)

| Layer | May contain | Must NOT contain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `api/<feature>.controller.ts` | guards/pipes/decorators, one delegation per method | logic, branching, transforms, inline types, repository/infrastructure imports |
| `application/<action>.use-case.ts` | multi-entity/multi-step orchestration, one transaction boundary, ordered post-commit events | controller/API-DTO imports, HTTP parsing, inline declarations |
| `application/<feature>.service.ts` | one focused capability (≤20 lines/method) | controller imports, `Promise.all\|allSettled\|any\|race`, calling a use-case, inline declarations |
| `domain/` | rules, policies, invariants, state-machine guards — pure | HTTP, persistence, vendor SDKs |
| `infrastructure/<feature>.repository.ts` | parameterized, bounded find/save/update/delete | business policy, transforms, controller/service/use-case/API-DTO imports |
| `adapters/<vendor>.adapter.ts` | wrap one vendor behind a typed app interface | leaking vendor types upward |
| `api/dto/` | request/response DTOs + validation decorators | logic, service/repository/infrastructure imports |
| `model/`, `@shared/*` | types, enums (+ `*_VALUES`), constants, config maps | logic, side effects |
| `lib/` | pure mappers, formatters, helpers | I/O, transport |

## Step list

1. Run the [shared workflow](./README.md) intake: read the spec and open every in-scope file (and its tests) first.
2. **Classify every artifact** in each target file by layer. Anything inline that belongs elsewhere gets a destination: types → `model/<feature>.types.ts` or `@shared/types`; enums → `@shared/enums` or `model/<feature>.enums.ts`; constants/maps → `<feature>.constants.ts`; helpers/mappers → `lib/`; DTOs → `api/dto/`.
3. **Rule on Service vs. Use case.** Default to a Service. Escalate to a Use case **only** when one operation mutates multiple entities under a single transaction/invariant AND coordinates ordered post-commit events. Confirm the call direction: use cases call services; services never call use cases.
4. **Check import legality** against the one-way rule — controller ↛ repository/infrastructure; use-case ↛ controller/api-dto; service ↛ controller; repository ↛ controller/service/use-case/api-dto; api-dto ↛ service/repository/infrastructure; `process.env` only in `config/`/`bootstrap/`. Flag every violation with a destination, not just a complaint.
5. **Verify adapter wrapping.** Each vendor SDK is imported only inside its `adapters/<vendor>.adapter.ts`; business code depends on the app-owned interface and never sees vendor types. Confirm the adapter is registered and documented in [/memory/library-boundaries.md](../memory/library-boundaries.md).
6. **Check the module surface.** Other modules consume this one only through its `index.ts` (or via events) — never a deep internal import. Map any circular dependency and break it (consumers import the shared export directly; `model/` never re-exports from a service).
7. **Plan the change as behavior-preserving moves** — pure relocations + facade/re-export for compatibility. Hand state or contract changes to [./backend-refactor-agent.md](./backend-refactor-agent.md); hand correctness verification to [./backend-code-reviewer.md](./backend-code-reviewer.md).
8. Apply the minimal change; keep existing tests green (only import paths may shift). See [decompose-large-file.md](../skills/decompose-large-file.md) for the safe-move mechanics.
9. Run all [quality gates](#quality-gates). Update [/context/architecture-map.md](../context/architecture-map.md) and [/memory/project-architecture.md](../memory/project-architecture.md) if a structural convention changed.

## Do / Don't

```typescript
// Don't — inline type + logic + magic string + repository import in a controller
import { ArticleRepository } from '@modules/article/infrastructure/article.repository';
@Controller('articles')
export class ArticleController {
  constructor(private readonly repo: ArticleRepository) {} // ✗ controller ↛ repository
  @Post()
  async create(@Body() body: { title: string; status: string }): Promise<unknown> {
    type Draft = { title: string };                 // ✗ inline type
    if (body.status === 'draft') { /* ... */ }       // ✗ logic + magic string
    return this.repo.save(body);
  }
}
```

```typescript
// Do — thin controller: typed DTO, one delegation, work lives in the application layer
@Controller('articles')
export class ArticleController {
  constructor(private readonly articles: ArticleService) {}

  @Post()
  create(@Body() dto: CreateArticleDto): Promise<ArticleResponseDto> {
    return this.articles.create(dto); // exactly one delegation, no logic
  }
}
```

```typescript
// Don't — cross-module deep import reaches into another module's internals
import { OrderRepository } from '@modules/order/infrastructure/order.repository';

// Do — consume the public surface only
import { OrderModulePublicApi } from '@modules/order'; // index.ts barrel
```

**Concrete finding (the shape to report):**

> `src/modules/invoice/api/invoice.controller.ts:42` — `markPaid()` loads the invoice, branches on `invoice.status === 'open'`, and writes via an injected `InvoiceRepository`. Three violations: controller holds logic (`architecture/controller-no-logic`), compares a magic string instead of `InvoiceStatus.OPEN` (rule 9), and imports the repository (`architecture/no-restricted-layer-imports`). **Move:** the branch + write become `InvoicePaymentService.markPaid(id, user)` in `application/`; the status check becomes `InvoicePolicy.assertPayable()` in `domain/`; the controller keeps a single delegation. Because it spans only one entity, a **Service** is correct — no use-case escalation.

## Rules / skills this role relies on

- **Rules:** [00-non-negotiable-rules.md](../rules/00-non-negotiable-rules.md), [01-architecture-and-module-boundaries.md](../rules/01-architecture-and-module-boundaries.md), [02-controllers-and-http-transport.md](../rules/02-controllers-and-http-transport.md), [03-application-services-and-use-cases.md](../rules/03-application-services-and-use-cases.md), [04-repositories-and-persistence.md](../rules/04-repositories-and-persistence.md), [06-types-enums-constants.md](../rules/06-types-enums-constants.md), [12-library-wrapping-and-adapters.md](../rules/12-library-wrapping-and-adapters.md), [13-eslint-and-typescript.md](../rules/13-eslint-and-typescript.md).
- **Skills:** [create-module.md](../skills/create-module.md), [create-service.md](../skills/create-service.md), [create-use-case.md](../skills/create-use-case.md), [create-controller.md](../skills/create-controller.md), [add-library-adapter.md](../skills/add-library-adapter.md), [decompose-large-file.md](../skills/decompose-large-file.md), [fix-eslint-typecheck.md](../skills/fix-eslint-typecheck.md).
- **Pairs with:** [backend-refactor-agent.md](./backend-refactor-agent.md) for safe-move mechanics and [backend-code-reviewer.md](./backend-code-reviewer.md) for the final correctness gate.
- **Memory:** record durable structural decisions in [/memory/project-architecture.md](../memory/project-architecture.md) and adapter ownership in [/memory/library-boundaries.md](../memory/library-boundaries.md); check [/memory/known-pitfalls.md](../memory/known-pitfalls.md) before deciding.

## Quality gates

```bash
npm run lint            # architecture/* boundaries + no-restricted-syntax + max-lines-per-function (20)
npm run typecheck       # tsgo --noEmit — no broken imports/this.x after moves
npm run test            # existing suite passes UNCHANGED (only import paths may shift)
npm run test:coverage   # ≥95% floor still holds per touched module
npm run build           # compiles clean
```

Never bypass a failing gate with `--no-verify`; a red gate means a move changed behavior or crossed a boundary — fix the root cause.

## Done-definition

- [ ] Every artifact lives in its correct layer; zero inline types/enums/constants/DTOs/maps in controllers/services/use-cases/repositories/guards/interceptors/adapters.
- [ ] Service-vs-Use-case is ruled correctly; use cases call services, never the reverse; transaction boundary sits in the use case.
- [ ] Every vendor SDK is adapter-wrapped; no vendor type leaks into business code; the adapter is registered and documented.
- [ ] Import boundaries are legal (`architecture/no-restricted-layer-imports` clean); no cross-module internal imports; no circular dependencies; `shared/` imports only `shared/`.
- [ ] Each touched module exposes a deliberate `index.ts` surface; compatibility re-exports kept where consumers depend on them.
- [ ] Behavior unchanged — existing tests pass without modification beyond import paths.
- [ ] All quality gates green; the architecture map and relevant memory files updated when a convention changed.
