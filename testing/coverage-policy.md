# Coverage Policy

> The coverage contract for this workspace: a **95% floor on every touched module** (critical paths near 100%), measured **per file** with Vitest 4 (v8 provider), and enforced at **pre-push**. This implements the canon — [/context/architecture-map.md](../context/architecture-map.md), [/rules/00-non-negotiable-rules.md](../rules/00-non-negotiable-rules.md), and [/rules/11-testing-and-coverage.md](../rules/11-testing-and-coverage.md) — and is tied to the live [vitest.config.mts](../vitest.config.mts).

Coverage is a hard gate, not a vanity metric. A green coverage run proves *which lines executed*, not that behavior is correct — pair it with the scenario discipline in [coverage-policy](./coverage-policy.md)'s sibling standards ([unit](./unit-testing-standard.md), [integration](./integration-testing-standard.md), [e2e](./e2e-testing-standard.md)).

## 1. The thresholds

| Metric | Floor (every touched module) | Target for critical logic |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `statements` | 95% | near 100% |
| `branches` | 90% (see note) | near 100% of **real** branches |
| `functions` | 95% | near 100% |
| `lines` | 95% | near 100% |

> **Branch-floor note.** The decorator downlevel transform injects one uncoverable synthetic branch on every `@Injectable`/`@Catch` class-declaration line, under both the istanbul and v8 providers ([known-pitfalls §I3](../memory/known-pitfalls.md)). The 90% branch floor absorbs only that artifact; every **real** branch in changed code must still be covered — reviewers check the per-file table, and lowering any threshold to absorb untested logic remains forbidden (§6).

**Critical logic** = domain policies, state machines, money/auth/permission/tenant code, and any path whose failure is unsafe. These aim for near-100% with rich scenario coverage (happy path + every validation/forbidden/conflict/boundary branch), not just a high number. A high percentage with shallow assertions is still inadequate.

These four numbers live in `coverage.thresholds` in [vitest.config.mts](../vitest.config.mts). Do **not** edit them down to make a red run pass — that is a silent waiver and is forbidden (see §6).

## 2. Per-module, not just global

A repository-wide average hides thin, untested files behind well-tested ones. This policy measures the **module you touched**, not the whole tree.

- **Mechanically:** run the gate scoped to the files in your change. `coverage.all: true` means even files with zero tests count against the floor, so a new untested file cannot ride on the global average.
- **In practice:** before you call work done, confirm the changed `*.service.ts`, `*.use-case.ts`, `*.repository.ts`, `domain/*`, and `lib/*` files each clear 95% on all four metrics — read the per-file table, not the summary line.
- **Per-file enforcement (recommended):** flip `thresholds.perFile: true` in [vitest.config.mts](../vitest.config.mts) so each source file must individually clear the floor. This makes "per touched module" mechanical instead of a code-review honor system. When `perFile` is on, the only way to pass is for every non-excluded file to stand on its own.

```ts
// Do — make the floor stand per file, so a thin file can't hide
coverage: {
  thresholds: { perFile: true, branches: 95, functions: 95, lines: 95, statements: 95 },
}
```

```ts
// Don't — lower the floor to silence a red run
coverage: { thresholds: { lines: 80 } } // unrecorded waiver — forbidden
```

## 3. How it is measured (Vitest 4 + istanbul)

The provider is **`@vitest/coverage-istanbul`** (not v8) for stable per-line, per-branch attribution. Config (abridged from [vitest.config.mts](../vitest.config.mts)):

```ts
coverage: {
  all: true,                 // count files with zero tests against the floor
  provider: 'istanbul',
  reporter: ['text', 'json-summary', 'lcov'],
  include: ['src/**/*.ts'],
  exclude: [ /* declarative / non-logic — see §4 */ ],
  thresholds: { branches: 95, functions: 95, lines: 95, statements: 95 },
}
```

- `text` → human-readable per-file table in the terminal.
- `json-summary` → machine-readable totals for CI/agents to parse.
- `lcov` → upload artifact for the PR coverage view.

Run it:

```bash
npm run test:coverage   # vitest run --coverage — fails the process if any threshold is unmet
```

Aliases (`@core`, `@modules`, `@shared`, …) are mirrored from `tsconfig.json` into [vitest.config.mts](../vitest.config.mts); keep both in sync or coverage will mis-resolve modules.

---

## 4. What is excluded (and why)

Coverage measures **logic**. Declarative, generated, and bootstrap files carry no behavior to assert, so they are removed from the denominator. The exclude list in [vitest.config.mts](../vitest.config.mts):

| Excluded glob | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `src/**/*.module.ts` | DI wiring, no branch logic |
| `src/**/*.dto.ts` | Validation lives in decorators; covered via controller/e2e tests |
| `src/**/index.ts` | Public-surface barrels — re-exports only |
| `src/**/*.spec.ts`, `test/**` | The tests themselves |
| `src/main.ts` | Entrypoint; bootstrap is exercised by e2e |

Extend the exclude list (consistent with the canon's "zero inline declarations") for pure declaration files when your project adds them: `*.types.ts`, `*.enums.ts`, `*.constants.ts`, `*.interface.ts`, and `src/shared/{enums,constants,types}/**` / `src/modules/**/model/**`. ORM entity files (`*.entity.ts`) may need exclusion too — decorator metadata injects synthetic, uncoverable branches on every property; test their real hooks elsewhere.

> **Strategic consequence:** extracting types/enums/constants into their proper `model/` and `@shared` files (an architecture rule — [/rules/06-types-enums-constants.md](../rules/06-types-enums-constants.md)) also *removes them from the coverage denominator*. Keeping declarations out of logic files is both clean architecture and a coverage strategy — your real logic files reach the floor more easily.

Never add a `*.service.ts`, `*.use-case.ts`, `*.repository.ts`, or `domain/` file to the exclude list to dodge the gate.

---

## 5. How it is enforced (pre-push)

The floor is enforced where it cannot be skipped: the **Husky pre-push hook** (see [/context/stack-and-toolchain.md](../context/stack-and-toolchain.md)).

| Gate | Hook | Runs | Blocks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lint + typecheck | pre-commit | `lint-staged` + `npm run typecheck` | commit |
| Commit format | commit-msg | `commitlint` (Conventional Commits) | commit |
| **Coverage + build** | **pre-push** | **`npm run test:coverage` + `npm run build`** | **push** |

A red suite or a coverage dip below any threshold makes `npm run test:coverage` exit non-zero, which fails pre-push and stops the push. CI re-runs the same command in a clean environment so the gate cannot be a local-only illusion.

- **Never** bypass with `git push --no-verify` (or `git commit --no-verify`) — banned by [/rules/00-non-negotiable-rules.md](../rules/00-non-negotiable-rules.md) and the SDLC policy in [/claude.md](../claude.md).
- The local hook and CI use the **same** `npm run test:coverage` entrypoint — no divergent shadow steps.

## 6. Waiver rules

The floor is the default; a waiver is the rare, recorded exception.

A waiver is only valid when **all** of the following hold:

1. **Genuinely unreachable defensive code** — e.g. a fall-through arm that an earlier guard already made impossible, or framework-injected synthetic branches. Not "I ran out of time."
2. **Narrowly scoped** with an istanbul hint *and* a one-line justification comment, attached to the smallest possible region:
   ```ts
   /* istanbul ignore next -- unreachable: prior guard rejects every other status */
   throw new UnexpectedStatusError(status);
   ```
3. **Recorded as a decision** in [/memory/testing-strategy.md](../memory/testing-strategy.md) (or the request's `12-coverage-plan.md` under [/docs/sdlc/](../docs/sdlc/)) with: what was waived, why it is unreachable/unsafe-to-test, who approved it, and the residual risk.
4. **Approved** by a reviewer with authority over the area — security/auth/money/tenant code requires the relevant security reviewer ([/agents/backend-security-reviewer.md](../agents/backend-security-reviewer.md)).

What is **not** a waiver: lowering a `thresholds.*` number, adding a logic file to `coverage.exclude`, deleting assertions to make a branch "covered", or `--no-verify`. Each of those is an unrecorded, blanket waiver and is forbidden.

> Prefer **refactoring for testability** over a waiver. An untestable branch usually signals a design smell — extract the policy to `domain/`, the side effect to an adapter, or the orchestration to a use case. See [/skills/decompose-large-file.md](../skills/decompose-large-file.md).

## 7. Workflow checklist

Tests come **first** ([/rules/11-testing-and-coverage.md](../rules/11-testing-and-coverage.md)): write/adjust the failing test, implement the minimal change, then prove the floor.

- [ ] Wrote/updated tests **before** the implementation change.
- [ ] `npm run test:coverage` is green — process exit 0, all four thresholds met.
- [ ] Each **touched** logic file (service / use-case / repository / domain / lib) clears 95% on statements, branches, functions, lines — checked the per-file table, not the global summary.
- [ ] Critical logic (auth, permissions, tenant, money, state machines) is near 100% with branch-level scenarios, not just a high number.
- [ ] Security surface tested where applicable: 401 unauthenticated, 403 unauthorized, IDOR/tenant isolation, 400 on malformed input, parameterized queries ([/testing/integration-testing-standard.md](./integration-testing-standard.md)).
- [ ] No threshold lowered, no logic file added to `exclude`, no deleted assertions to fake a branch.
- [ ] Any waiver is istanbul-scoped, justified inline, **and** recorded + approved per §6.
- [ ] Pre-push gate (`test:coverage` + `build`) passes without `--no-verify`.
