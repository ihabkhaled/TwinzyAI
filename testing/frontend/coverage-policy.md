# Frontend Coverage Policy (`apps/web`)

Coverage is measured by Vitest's v8 provider and enforced as build-breaking thresholds in
`apps/web/vitest.config.mts`. `npm run test:coverage` fails — locally and in CI — when any threshold
is missed. Reports: `text`, `html`, `lcov`.

## Exact thresholds (from `apps/web/vitest.config.mts`)

```ts
thresholds: {
  lines: 95,
  statements: 95,
  functions: 95,
  branches: 95,
  'src/**/{utils,helpers,mappers,schemas}/**/*.ts': {
    lines: 100,
    statements: 100,
    functions: 100,
    branches: 100,
  },
  'src/**/queries/*query-keys*.ts': {
    lines: 100,
    statements: 100,
    functions: 100,
    branches: 100,
  },
},
```

- **Global: 95%** lines/statements/functions/branches across everything measured.
- **Pure logic: 100%** for every file under a `utils/`, `helpers/`, `mappers/`, or `schemas/`
  directory anywhere in `apps/web/src`, and for query-key builder files (e.g.
  `apps/web/src/modules/<feature>/queries/<feature>-query-keys.ts`). These files are deterministic
  functions with no environment excuses — an untested branch there is an untested business rule.

## What is measured, what is excluded, and why

Coverage `include` is `src/modules/**`, `src/shared/**`, `src/packages/**` — the code we own.
Excluded:

| Exclusion                                     | Why                                                                                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `**/*.test.ts`, `**/*.test.tsx`, `**/test/**` | Test code is not product code; counting it inflates numbers.                                                                                 |
| `**/types/**`, `**/*.types.ts`                | Type-only files emit no runtime statements; "covering" them is noise.                                                                        |
| `**/index.ts`                                 | Barrel files (module public surfaces like `apps/web/src/modules/<feature>/index.ts`) are re-exports with no logic. Excluding them keeps the public-surface pattern free. |

`apps/web/src/app` (routes/layouts) and `apps/web/src/tests` are outside `include`: route files are
thin composition proven by Playwright suites, and test infrastructure is exercised by every run.

## No fake coverage

Thresholds measure execution, not verification. The following are violations regardless of the
resulting percentage:

- **Assertion-free execution.** A test that renders or calls code without asserting its observable
  outcome adds coverage and zero protection. Every `it` block MUST contain at least one meaningful
  assertion.
- **Snapshotting logic.** `toMatchSnapshot` on computed objects to "cover" branches hides the
  contract. Assert explicit values (see the mapper examples in
  [unit-testing-standard.md](unit-testing-standard.md)).
- **Mocking to reach branches.** Mocking a module's own internals to force an otherwise unreachable
  branch means the branch is dead code — delete it (knip and review will find it anyway) or redesign
  so it is reachable.
- **Exclusion creep.** Adding files to `coverage.exclude`, or `/* v8 ignore */` comments, requires a
  documented, reviewed exception, exactly like an `eslint-disable`.
- **Threshold edits.** Lowering any number in `apps/web/vitest.config.mts` is an architecture
  decision, not a PR-level fix. It requires an ADR
  ([architecture/adrs/README.md](../../architecture/adrs/README.md)).

## Working with the policy

- Write pure logic test-first ([testing-strategy.md](testing-strategy.md)) and 100% falls out
  naturally; chasing coverage after the fact is the smell this policy exists to prevent.
- Check the HTML report (`coverage/index.html` after `npm run test:coverage`) to find missed
  branches — uncovered lines in a mapper or util are always a missing input class in the test table.
- Enforcement points: pre-push runs the test suite, and CI runs `test:coverage` as a blocking job —
  see [quality-gates.md](quality-gates.md).
