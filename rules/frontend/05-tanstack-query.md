# 05 — TanStack Query

All server state lives in the TanStack Query cache, accessed exclusively through the wrapper
`apps/web/src/packages/query` (`useAppQuery`, `useAppMutation`, `useAppSuspenseQuery`,
`useAppQueryClient`, `AppQueryProvider`). Importing `@tanstack/react-query` directly is a
`no-raw-package-imports` violation.

## Query keys come from builders — always

Every module has exactly one key-builder file. Inline key arrays anywhere else are an ESLint error
(`no-inline-query-keys`, [docs/eslint/no-inline-query-keys.md](../../docs/eslint/no-inline-query-keys.md)):

```ts
export const articleQueryKeys = {
  root: ['articles'] as const,
  lists: () => [...articleQueryKeys.root, 'list'] as const,
  list: (params: ArticleListParams) => [...articleQueryKeys.lists(), params] as const,
  details: () => [...articleQueryKeys.root, 'detail'] as const,
  detail: (id: string) => [...articleQueryKeys.details(), id] as const,
};
```

(`apps/web/src/modules/articles/queries/article-query-keys.ts`)

Keys MUST be hierarchical (`root → lists → list(params)`) so invalidation can target any scope.
Key-builder files carry a 100% coverage requirement
([testing/frontend/coverage-policy.md](../../testing/frontend/coverage-policy.md)).

## Query options are exported for reuse

Each query file exports a `build<X>QueryOptions` function alongside the hook, so tests, prefetching,
and the hook itself share one definition:

```ts
export function buildArticlesListQueryOptions(params: ArticleListParams) {
  return {
    queryKey: articleQueryKeys.list(params),
    queryFn: () => listArticles(params),
  };
}
```

(`apps/web/src/modules/articles/queries/article.queries.ts`)

`queryFn` MUST call a service function ([04-services-api-gateway.md](04-services-api-gateway.md)) —
never a gateway or `httpClient` directly.

## Invalidation is exact and centralized

Every mutation that changes server data MUST invalidate through a named helper in the module's
`queries/*.invalidate.ts` file — never an ad-hoc `invalidateQueries` call with a hand-written key:

```ts
export function invalidateArticleLists(queryClient: QueryClientLike): Promise<void> {
  return queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: articleQueryKeys.lists() });
}
```

(`apps/web/src/modules/articles/queries/article.invalidate.ts`)

Invalidate the narrowest scope that is actually stale (lists after create, one detail after edit).
Blanket `root` invalidation requires a comment explaining why.

## Mutation pattern

`apps/web/src/modules/articles/queries/article.mutations.ts` is the template: `useAppMutation` +
service function as `mutationFn` + invalidate helper in `onSuccess`. Success/error toasts and
navigation belong to the consuming hook or container layer — mutation files stay UI-free. Optimistic
updates are allowed only with a rollback in `onError` and a test covering the rollback path.

## Hard boundaries

- Server data MUST NOT be copied into Zustand stores or React state "for convenience" — the cache is
  the single source of truth ([06-zustand.md](06-zustand.md)).
- Query files MUST NOT import components, containers, or `apps/web/src/app` (layer policy in
  [eslint/architecture.config.mjs](../../eslint/architecture.config.mjs)).
- The `@tanstack/eslint-plugin-query` rules run as errors (exhaustive query deps included) inside the
  frontend ESLint config; the query wrapper is their owner.
