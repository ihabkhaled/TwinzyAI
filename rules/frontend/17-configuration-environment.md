# 17 — Configuration and Environment

Environment variables are configuration inputs with a typed, validated contract — never ambient strings
scattered through the code.

## The two facades

- **Client-safe:** `publicEnv` from `apps/web/src/packages/env`, defined in
  `apps/web/src/packages/env/public-env.ts`. Zod-validated with local defaults (`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ENV`
  defaults to `local`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to `http://localhost:3000`). Exposes camelCase fields
  (`publicEnv.appEnv`, `publicEnv.appUrl`).
- **Server-only:** `getServerEnv()` from `@/packages/env/server` (`apps/web/src/packages/env/server.ts`).
  Imports the `server-only` marker, so a client import is a build-time error. Validates
  `SERVER_API_BASE_URL` and `SERVER_API_MOCKING`, caches the parsed result.
- Raw `process.env` reads anywhere outside these facades are banned by
  [no-process-env-outside-config](../../docs/eslint/no-process-env-outside-config.md). Derived app
  configuration lives in `apps/web/src/shared/config/app-config.ts` (`appConfig`), which consumes the
  facades. Note the repo-wide Twinzy non-negotiable in [CLAUDE.md](../../CLAUDE.md): the Gemini model
  name comes from `.env` (`GEMINI_MODEL`) and is never hardcoded — the same discipline applies to every
  environment input.

## Why the public/private split is structural

`NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined into the client bundle at build time — they are public by definition
and MUST never hold secrets. Everything else exists only in the server process. The split is enforced
three ways: naming (`NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix vs `SERVER_` prefix), the `server-only` marker, and the
[no-server-only-import-in-client](../../docs/eslint/no-server-only-import-in-client.md) lint rule. Public
values MUST be read with static dot-access (`process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`), never dynamic keys, or
Next.js cannot inline them.

## The `.env.example` contract

[.env.example](../../.env.example) is the canonical list of every variable the app reads, grouped into a
public block and a server-only block, each with a comment explaining non-obvious values. A variable that
is not in `.env.example` does not exist. `.env*` files are gitignored; `.env.example` is the only
committed env file.

## `SERVER_API_MOCKING`

- Default `enabled`: the BFF gateway (`/api/gateway/[...path]`) serves module mock fixtures (e.g.
  `apps/web/src/modules/articles/api/articles.mock.ts`) so the app runs with zero backend.
- Set `disabled` to proxy to `SERVER_API_BASE_URL` (the NestJS API in `apps/api`) instead. Client code
  never knows the difference — it only ever calls same-origin gateway paths via `httpClient` +
  `buildGatewayPath` (`apps/web/src/shared/api/api-routes.constants.ts`).

## Adding a variable — the required steps

1. **Schema:** add the field to `publicEnvSchema` in `public-env.ts` or `serverEnvSchema` in
   `server.ts`, with a Zod type and a sensible local default (or make it required and let startup fail
   loudly).
2. **Types:** extend the `ProcessEnv` declaration in `apps/web/src/packages/env/env.d.ts` so
   `process.env.<NAME>` is typed at the single place it is read.
3. **Expose it:** add a camelCase field to the `PublicEnv` / `ServerEnv` interface and the exported
   object — consumers use the parsed field, never the raw name.
4. **Document:** add the variable with a comment to [.env.example](../../.env.example).
5. **Docs:** if the variable changes behavior (like `SERVER_API_MOCKING`), update this rule and any
   affected runbook under [runbooks/](../../runbooks/README.md).

Never skip step 1 — an unvalidated variable is a runtime typo waiting for production.

## Non-env configuration

Build-time configuration lives in [apps/web/next.config.ts](../../apps/web/next.config.ts) (headers,
typedRoutes, image hosts) and MUST NOT read server env directly; feature constants live in module
`constants/` layers, shared ones in `apps/web/src/shared/constants`. See
[07-types-enums-constants.md](07-types-enums-constants.md).
